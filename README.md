# SnapArt Studio - Server-Side

Welcome to SnapArt Studio's server-side application repository. SnapArt Studio is a creative platform that brings art to life with stunning 3D logos and designs. Our server-side application provides the backend infrastructure for the platform. Explore the key features and technologies used in this project:

## Key Features:

1. **Database Interaction:** The server-side application is responsible for managing interactions with the MongoDB database. It handles creating, updating, and retrieving data related to services, orders, and more.

2. **RESTful API:** We've implemented a RESTful API with endpoints for services, orders, and more. The API allows the client-side application to communicate with the server, enabling a seamless user experience.

3. **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication is a critical component of SnapArt Studio. The server-side application leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.

4. **Data Validation and Storage:** The server validates incoming data, ensuring that only valid and authorized requests are processed. It stores user orders and service details, making them available for retrieval.

## Technologies Used:

- **Node.js and Express:** The server is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment for JavaScript.

- **MongoDB:** We use MongoDB as the database of choice for storing data related to services, orders, and user information. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability.

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWT is employed for user authentication, allowing secure access to user-specific data and services.

- **CORS and Body-Parser:** We use CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and Body-Parser for parsing incoming JSON data in HTTP requests.

- **dotenv:** The dotenv package is utilized to manage environment variables securely, including database credentials and API keys.

## Getting Started:

To run the server-side application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file to include your MongoDB connection string, API keys, and other sensitive information.

4. Start the server using either `npm start` for production or `npm run dev` for development with nodemon.

5. Access the API by making HTTP requests to the defined endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/services`).
